# Beckett Digital Manuscript Project (BDMP) – TEI/XML Encoding

This repository documents my technical and editorial contributions as a **Research Software Engineer** to the **Beckett Digital Manuscript Project (BDMP)**, within the framework of the project *Editing Beckett: Towards a Bilingual Digital Genetic Edition of Samuel Beckett's Works* at the **University of Oxford** (2022–2025).

## 📚 Project Overview

The BDMP is a major international digital humanities initiative that produces genetic editions of Samuel Beckett’s manuscripts. It provides comprehensive, annotated transcriptions of Beckett’s draft materials across languages and genres. These editions are encoded using a **customized TEI P5 schema** to ensure structural consistency, textual accuracy, and long-term preservation.

## 🔧 My Role

- Developing and delivering **TEI/XML-based digital editions** using the BDMP’s custom encoding model  
- Contributing to **text encoding, collation, and image-text alignment**  
- Managing the **project-specific TEI P5 schema**, ensuring it reflects evolving editorial requirements  
- Supporting the **technical infrastructure** behind the editorial process and publication pipeline  
- Training and mentoring team members and interns in encoding workflows and TEI best practices  
- Collaborating with editorial and technical stakeholders across institutions

## 📦 Repository Contents

This repository may contain:
- Sample or placeholder **TEI/XML files** following BDMP conventions
