# Beckett Digital Manuscript Project (BDMP) â€“ Encoding and Image Processing Demonstration

This repository showcases a synthetic example of the work I performed as part of the **Beckett Digital Manuscript Project (BDMP)**. The content is entirely fictional and serves to demonstrate the technical skills and methodologies applied during the project.

## Project Overview

The BDMP aims to digitally reunite Samuel Beckett's manuscripts, facilitating genetic criticism and scholarly research. The project involves:

- **Digital Facsimiles**: High-resolution scans of manuscripts.
- **Transcriptions**: TEI-compliant XML transcriptions of Beckett's works.
- **Annotations**: Detailed markup of textual features and revisions.
- **Image-Text Integration**: Linking facsimile images with corresponding transcriptions.

For more information, visit the [BDMP website](https://www.beckettarchive.org/).

## My Contributions

In my role, I was responsible for:

- **TEI P5 XML Encoding**: TEI P5 XML Encoding: Structured complex, multilayered manuscript data using TEI P5 XML, including customization of tagsets, hierarchical encoding of variant readings, and integration of rendering metadata. Developed encoding pipelines within the BDMP architecture.
- **Image Processing with GIMP**: Image-Text Alignment: Carried out pixel-precise zoning and annotation of manuscript images. Created metadata-bound coordinates to enable facsimile-transcription linkage in XML. Used GIMP to preprocess images (cropping, contrast adjustment) to prepare them for integration into the XML-based viewer.
- **Zoning and Image-Text Mapping**: Defining zones within manuscript images to align with textual transcriptions, enabling interactive features for users.
- **Validation and Quality Control**: Ensuring adherence to project-specific encoding guidelines and standards.


## Technical Skills Demonstrated

- **TEI P5 XML**: Encoding complex textual features and manuscript variations.
- **GIMP**: Image editing and preparation for digital publication.
- **oXygen XML Editor**: Utilizing advanced features for XML editing and validation.
- **Relax NG**: Implementing schema-based validation for XML documents.
- **XSLT & XPath**: Transforming and querying XML data for various outputs.
